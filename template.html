<p><br></p><p>Thank you for reviewing my application. My name is {name}.</p><p><br></p>
<p>I am writing to apply for the {title} position, as advertised&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">on Monash University’s Career Gateway. I am currently in my final year of a Bachelor of Information&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">Technology and Systems degree at Monash University, majoring in Applications Development and Networks. I&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">am keen to apply my knowledge and key skills gained through both university study and industry related work&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">experience, particularly with regard to the management and support of computer networks and network&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">management.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;"><br></span></p>
<p>My enthusiasm to work at Business Networks has been encouraged by your reputation of working creatively to&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">provide customers with excellent technical support. Solving clients’ computing related problems to ensure that&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">their IT use is effective and efficient would be very satisfying. I thoroughly enjoy the technical challenges of&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">problem solving and working with clients to bring about speedy resolutions. Business Networks also appeals&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">to me because it is a company which is expanding and this will bring the challenges and growth I am looking&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">forward to within my career.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My studies have assisted me in gaining relevant technical skills and my employment experience in the retail&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">sector has enabled me to extend my skills in the areas of communication and problem solving. My experience&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">as a volunteer has been based around my motivation to become involved and ensure that programs are&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">delivered effectively. I enjoy taking the initiative to create positive outcomes for people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through my part time employment in the retail sector, selling laptops at JB Hifi, I have proven a strong&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">customer focus with the ability to communicate and deal with people from a diverse range of backgrounds. I&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">have had to handle many challenging customer enquiries and have learnt to resolve them in a professional&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">and timely manner. This has also developed my ability to explain IT concepts to people who do not have a&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">technical background.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for reviewing my application. Enclosed are my resume and academic transcripts. I believe that I&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">have demonstrated the qualities and skills that you seek and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">application in more detail at an interview.&nbsp;</span></p>
