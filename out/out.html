<p><br></p><p>Thank you for reviewing my application. My name is Ran Ding.</p><p><br></p>
<p>I am writing to apply for the sadf position with Business Networks, as advertised <span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">on Monash University’s Career Gateway. I am currently in my final year of a Bachelor of Information </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">Technology and Systems degree at Monash University, majoring in Applications Development and Networks. I </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">am keen to apply my knowledge and key skills gained through both university study and industry related work </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">experience, particularly with regard to the management and support of computer networks and network </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">management. </span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;"><br></span></p>
<p>My enthusiasm to work at Business Networks has been encouraged by your reputation of working creatively to <span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">provide customers with excellent technical support. Solving clients’ computing related problems to ensure that </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">their IT use is effective and efficient would be very satisfying. I thoroughly enjoy the technical challenges of </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">problem solving and working with clients to bring about speedy resolutions. Business Networks also appeals </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">to me because it is a company which is expanding and this will bring the challenges and growth I am looking </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">forward to within my career. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My studies have assisted me in gaining relevant technical skills and my employment experience in the retail <span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">sector has enabled me to extend my skills in the areas of communication and problem solving. My experience </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">as a volunteer has been based around my motivation to become involved and ensure that programs are </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">delivered effectively. I enjoy taking the initiative to create positive outcomes for people. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through my part time employment in the retail sector, selling laptops at JB Hifi, I have proven a strong <span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">customer focus with the ability to communicate and deal with people from a diverse range of backgrounds. I </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">have had to handle many challenging customer enquiries and have learnt to resolve them in a professional </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">and timely manner. This has also developed my ability to explain IT concepts to people who do not have a </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">technical background. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for reviewing my application. Enclosed are my resume and academic transcripts. I believe that I <span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">have demonstrated the qualities and skills that you seek and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">application in more detail at an interview. </span></p>
<p> </p><p><br></p>
<p>Yours sincerely, </p>
<p>Ran Ding</p>
